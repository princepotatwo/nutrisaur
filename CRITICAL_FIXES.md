# Critical Fixes for Nutrisaur App

## Issues Found in Logs:

### 1. **NetworkOnMainThreadException** ❌
```
android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException
at com.example.nutrisaur11.CommunityUserManager.makeApiRequest(CommunityUserManager.java:152)
```

### 2. **Database Error** ❌
```
Database error: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'status' in 'field list'
```

### 3. **Google Sign-In Error Code 10** ❌
```
GoogleSignUp com.example.nutrisaur11 W signInResult:failed code=10
```

## Fixes Required:

### Fix 1: NetworkOnMainThreadException
The app is making network calls on the main thread, which is not allowed in Android.

**Solution**: All network calls must be moved to background threads.

### Fix 2: Database Column Error
The database is missing a 'status' column that the app is trying to access.

**Solution**: Update the database schema or fix the query.

### Fix 3: Google Sign-In Error Code 10
This is still the DEVELOPER_ERROR, likely due to the above issues preventing proper initialization.

## Immediate Actions Needed:

1. **Fix the NetworkOnMainThreadException** - This is blocking the app from working properly
2. **Fix the database schema** - The missing 'status' column is causing database errors
3. **Test Google Sign-In** - After fixing the above issues

## Root Cause:
The Google Sign-In error code 10 is likely a **secondary issue** caused by the primary problems:
- Network calls on main thread
- Database schema issues
- App initialization failures

## Next Steps:
1. Fix the NetworkOnMainThreadException first
2. Fix the database schema issue
3. Test Google Sign-In after these fixes
4. The Google Sign-In should work once the app initializes properly
