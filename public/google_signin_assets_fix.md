# Google Sign-In Assets Fix

## Problem Identified
The Android app was using the wrong `google-services.json` file:
- **Wrong file**: `app/src/main/assets/google-services (8).json`
- **Correct file**: `app/src/main/assets/google-services.json`

## Root Cause
The Android app was reading from the `assets` folder instead of the main `app/` directory, and the file had an incorrect name with "(8)" in it.

## Fix Applied
1. **Copied correct file**: `app/google-services.json` → `app/src/main/assets/google-services.json`
2. **Removed old file**: Deleted `google-services (8).json`
3. **Verified configuration**: OAuth client is now properly configured

## Current Configuration
The Android app now has the correct `google-services.json` with:
- ✅ **OAuth client configured**: `43537903747-2nd9mtmm972ucoirho2sthkqlu8mct6b.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- ✅ **Certificate hash**: `f7fa7bac3388cabac62dfd8a09ede29c3c508010`
- ✅ **Package name**: `com.example.nutrisaur11`
- ✅ **Client type**: 1 (Android client)

## Expected Result
- **Error Code 10 should be resolved** - Android app now has proper OAuth configuration
- **Google Sign-In should work** - Correct client ID and certificate hash
- **No more developer errors** - OAuth client is properly configured

## Files Changed
- ✅ `app/src/main/assets/google-services.json` - Now contains correct OAuth configuration
- ❌ `app/src/main/assets/google-services (8).json` - Removed (incorrect file)

## Next Steps
1. **Clean and rebuild** your Android project
2. **Test Google Sign-In** again
3. **Check Android logs** for any remaining errors
4. **Test on physical device** for best results

The Android app should now properly authenticate with Google using the correct OAuth client configuration!
