# Google Sign-In Real Issue Analysis

## Current Problem
- **Google Sign-In fails with error code 10 (DEVELOPER_ERROR)**
- **This happens BEFORE any backend API calls**
- **No user is created in community_users table because Google Sign-In never succeeds**

## Root Cause
Error code 10 means there's a configuration mismatch between:
1. **Google Console settings**
2. **App configuration** 
3. **Device/emulator setup**

## The Real Fix

### Option 1: Fix Google Console Configuration
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select project: `nutrisaur-ebf29`
3. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
4. **Delete the existing Android OAuth client**
5. **Create a NEW Android OAuth client** with:
   - **Package name**: `com.example.nutrisaur11`
   - **SHA-1 fingerprint**: `F7:FA:7B:AC:33:88:CA:BA:C6:2D:FD:8A:09:ED:E2:9C:3C:50:80:10`
6. **Download new google-services.json**
7. **Replace the file in your app**

### Option 2: Use Web Client ID (Already implemented)
We already changed the app to use the Web Client ID instead of Android Client ID.

### Option 3: Test on Real Device
- Google Sign-In often doesn't work in emulators
- Test on a real Android device

## Expected Flow After Fix
1. ✅ User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. ✅ Google Sign-In dialog opens
3. ✅ User selects Google account
4. ✅ App receives ID token
5. ✅ App calls backend API with token
6. ✅ Backend verifies token with Google
7. ✅ Backend creates/logs in user to community_users table
8. ✅ App navigates to appropriate screen

## Current Status
- ❌ Step 1 fails (Google Sign-In dialog never opens)
- ❌ Steps 2-8 never happen
- ❌ No user in community_users table

The fix is to resolve the Google Sign-In configuration issue first.
