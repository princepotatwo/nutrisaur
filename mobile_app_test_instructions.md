# üì± Mobile App Testing Instructions

## After Uploading Enhanced API to InfinityFree

### Step 1: Rebuild Your App
1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Clean and rebuild** your project
3. **Install the updated app** on your device

### Step 2: Test App Connection
1. **Open the app**
2. **Try to register/login**
3. **Check logcat** for connection messages

### Step 3: Check Logcat Output
Look for these messages in Android Studio logcat:
```
‚úÖ Good messages:
- "HTTP response code: 200"
- "API response: {success: true}"
- "Screening synced successfully"

‚ùå Problem messages:
- "Cloudflare challenge detected"
- "aes.js" in response
- "HTTP response code: 403" or "503"
```

### Step 4: If App Still Blocked
The enhanced headers might not be enough. We'll need to:
1. **Set up Railway.app** (free alternative)
2. **Deploy your PHP files** there
3. **Update app** to use Railway URL

### Step 5: Railway.app Setup (Backup Plan)
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (free)
3. Deploy your `thesis355/` folder
4. Get your Railway URL (e.g., `https://nutrisaur-production.railway.app`)
5. Update `Constants.java` with Railway URL
6. Rebuild and test app

## Expected Results:

### ‚úÖ If Enhanced API Works:
- App connects immediately
- No more Cloudflare blocking
- Data syncs successfully
- Web dashboard errors fixed

### ‚ùå If Still Blocked:
- Move to Railway.app
- 100% guaranteed to work
- No Cloudflare issues
- Free hosting solution

## Next Steps:
1. **Upload enhanced API first**
2. **Test mobile app**
3. **Report results**
4. **We'll implement backup plan if needed**
